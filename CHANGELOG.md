# Changelog

All notable public changes to Swipium are documented here.

## Unreleased

## 1.1.0 - 2026-06-01

This release expands the public tool surface from 42 to 59 tools, advancing the roadmap's device-parity, visual-intelligence, seeded-state, and reporting phases. It is a minor release: the additions are backward compatible, existing tools and input schemas are unchanged, and clients on 1.0.1 keep working and gain the new tools after a restart.

### Added

- Device and app environment parity tools so common setup no longer needs raw `adb` or `simctl`: `qa_device_info`, `qa_permissions`, `qa_orientation`, `qa_geolocation`, `qa_network`, `qa_metro`, `qa_app_control`, `qa_screen_info`, and `qa_screen_record`. Mutating actions are consent-gated and recorded as environment changes; network changes are auto-restored at report end.
- Local-first visual intelligence: `qa_visual` for baseline capture, regression diff, image-target matching with tappable coordinates, and optional OCR; `qa_visual_find_text` for OCR text location with coordinate-space conversion.
- Seeded state so a blocked precondition can be created and verified instead of only reported: `qa_seed`, `qa_state_prepare`, `qa_state_verify`, and `qa_state_teardown`. All mutating actions are consent-gated.
- Report history tools: `qa_report_compare` to diff a run against a baseline report, and `qa_run_history` for pass rate, failures, flaky flows, and confidence calibration across local runs.
- New MCP prompt `swipium_guardrail_validation` that drives a non-destructive check confirming Swipium refuses bundle-loss actions on debug RN/Expo builds.

### Fixed

- Fixed default iOS text entry so replace-mode typing clears focused fields with current WebDriverAgent attributes and falls back to keyboard deletion when needed.
- Fixed `qa_test_this` build handling so successful Expo iOS builds are not reported as app build failures when artifact resolution needs follow-up.
- Fixed `qa_prepare_ios_target` so structured iOS mode is reported only after a WebDriverAgent session is created and attached to the run.
- Fixed report verdicts so Swipium tool limitations do not block the app status; they are reported under coverage and tool status.
- `qa_metro` stop now signals the entire detached process group, so the Metro bundler holding port 8081 is terminated rather than only its `npx` launcher, and it only signals a PID still confirmed to belong to a Metro/Node process. Any Swipium-started Metro is also stopped on server shutdown so a budget stop or crash does not leave a bundler running.
- `qa_screen_record` status now reports an Android time-limit recording that has stopped on its own as auto-stopped instead of implying it is still capturing, while retaining the entry so the video can still be saved.

### Changed

- Added exploration diagnostics for visible action-like text that is not exposed as clickable or editable.
- Improved app-map queries by indexing visible copy from source files.
- Improved generated POM suites by segmenting recorded actions by screen identity.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- Updated iOS WDA point taps to use the current `/wda/tap` route with legacy fallback.
- Added focused typing fallback through `/wda/keys` for iOS WDA sessions.
- Made overlay clearing tolerate unsupported driver probes and use native WDA alert actions.

### Changed

- Added platform-specific `qa_doctor` readiness for Android Emulator and iOS Simulator.
- Clarified Expo Android local run planning for `npx expo run:android --variant debug`.
- Split report output into app status and coverage status.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Initial public release of Swipium.
- Limited v1 MCP tool surface focused on Android Emulator and iOS Simulator workflows.
- Core mobile QA flow: prepare a simulator target, observe the app, act on the UI, run smoke checks, capture evidence, and generate reports.
- Durable app knowledge map for storing tested screens, flows, findings, and generated test assets.
- Flow and test-suite generation from recorded or explored behavior.
- Consent gates for mutating actions and sensitive automation steps.
- Secret redaction in reports, artifacts, and generated automation.

### Security

- Latest-version-only security support.
- Production dependency audit included in the release check.
- Public security contact: hi@swipium.com.

### Not In Scope For v1

- Real-device certification.
- Jira or external tracker integration.
- Broad public support for every internal or experimental tool.
